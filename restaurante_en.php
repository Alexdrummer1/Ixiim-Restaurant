			<h1>ABOUT IXI'IM</h1>
			
			<p>Ixi'im Restaurant embodies Mexican cuisine with a touch of the Southeast Mexico. The gastronomic offer was designed by Chef Jorge Vallejo (Quintonil Restaurant, located in Mexico City), which is characterized by innovation and simplicity, leading Mexican cuisine to a high level of refinement.</p><br>
            <p>At Ixi'im we use both modern and ancestral techniques to recreate traditional flavors, using and highlighting the local products and honoring flavors that are part of the Mexican culture.</p><br>
            <p>Ixi'im is the Signature Restaurant of Chablé Resort & Spa (Yucatán, Mexico), recognized for integrating the practices of sustainable agriculture and organic farming. Most of our ingredients are harvested directly from our Ka'anche's (Mayan cultivation technique) which translates to freshness and flavor in our dishes.</p>
